## Testing Methods

### Method 1: Backend Testing (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Start the Simple Backend
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Start the simple backend server
python simple_backend.py
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8000` with these endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /api/v1/processing/demo` - Demo OCR processing
- `POST /api/v1/processing/process` - File upload OCR
- `GET /api/v1/ocr/status` - OCR service status

#### Step 2: Test OCR Endpoints

**Test 1: Health Check**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

**Test 2: Demo OCR Processing**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/processing/demo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "test": true,
    "file_name": "test-invoice.pdf",
    "company_id": "test-company"
  }'
```

**Test 3: File Upload OCR**
```bash
# Create a test file
echo "Mock invoice content" > test-invoice.pdf

# Upload and process
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/processing/process \
  -F "file=@test-invoice.pdf" \
  -F "company_id=test-company"
```

**Test 4: OCR Service Status**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ocr/status
```

### Method 2: Automated Testing

#### Run the Complete Test Suite
```bash
# Run the comprehensive OCR test
node test-ocr-complete.js
```

This will test:
- Backend health and connectivity
- OCR demo endpoint functionality
- File upload and processing
- Data extraction validation
- Confidence score validation
- Error handling
- Performance metrics

### Method 3: Frontend Testing

#### Start the Frontend
```bash
# Navigate to web directory
cd web

# Start the frontend
npm run dev
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000` and test:
- Invoice upload page
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- OCR processing results
- Data validation and editing
- Approval workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Backend Won't Start
**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`
**Solution**: Use the simple backend:
```bash
cd backend
python simple_backend.py
```

#### 2. Port Already in Use
**Issue**: Port 8000 already in use
**Solution**: Kill existing processes:
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /f /pid <PID>

# Or use a different port
python simple_backend.py --port 8001
```

#### 3. Import Errors
**Issue**: Relative import errors
**Solution**: The simple backend bypasses these issues and works directly.

#### 4. Frontend Won't Start
**Issue**: npm errors
**Solution**: Test backend-only first, then frontend:
```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Production Testing

### Azure Form Recognizer Setup

For production testing with real Azure OCR:

1. **Get Azure Credentials**:
   - Azure Form Recognizer endpoint
   - Azure Form Recognizer key

2. **Configure Environment**:
```env
AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER_KEY=your-azure-key
OCR_PROVIDER=azure
```

3. **Test with Real Documents**:
   - Upload actual PDF invoices
   - Test various formats and layouts
   - Validate accuracy against known data

### Performance Testing

#### Load Testing
```bash
# Test multiple concurrent uploads
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/processing/demo \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"test\": true, \"file_name\": \"test-$i.pdf\"}" &
done
```

#### Response Time Testing
- **Target**: < 5 seconds for processing
- **Acceptable**: < 10 seconds for complex documents
- **Excellent**: < 2 seconds for simple documents
