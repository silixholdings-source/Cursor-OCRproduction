## 🔄 **2-WAY MATCHING IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Overview**
2-way matching compares invoices against Purchase Orders in the GP Payables Management module, ensuring accurate invoice processing and approval workflows.

### **Implementation**

#### **Basic 2-Way Match**
```python
async def test_two_way_matching():
    # Perform 2-way match (Invoice vs PO)
    result = await gp_integration.perform_two_way_match(
        invoice_id="INV-2024-001",
        company_db="TWO",
        po_number="PO-2024-001"  # Optional - will search if not provided
    )
    
    print(f"Match Status: {result.status.value}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence_score:.1%}")
    print(f"Variances: {len(result.variances)}")
    print(f"Auto-Approval Eligible: {result.auto_approval_eligible}")
```

#### **Variance Analysis**
```python
# Analyze variances found during matching
for variance in result.variances:
    print(f"Variance Type: {variance.type.value}")
    print(f"Amount: ${variance.variance_amount}")
    print(f"Percentage: {variance.variance_percentage:.1f}%")
    print(f"Within Tolerance: {variance.within_tolerance}")
    print(f"Explanation: {variance.explanation}")
    print(f"Suggested Action: {variance.suggested_action}")
```

### **Test Scenarios**

#### **Perfect Match Scenario**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_perfect_match():
    """Test perfect 2-way match with no variances"""
    
    # Invoice: $1,250.00, PO: $1,250.00
    # Expected: PERFECT_MATCH, 98%+ confidence, auto-approval eligible
    
    result = await gp_integration.perform_two_way_match(
        "INV-001", "TWO", "PO-001"
    )
    
    assert result.status == MatchStatus.PERFECT_MATCH
    assert result.confidence_score >= 0.98
    assert result.auto_approval_eligible == True
    assert len(result.variances) == 0
```

#### **Price Variance Scenario**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_price_variance():
    """Test 2-way match with price variance exceeding tolerance"""
    
    # Invoice: $1,250.00, PO: $1,200.00 (4.17% variance)
    # Expected: PRICE_VARIANCE, requires approval
    
    result = await gp_integration.perform_two_way_match(
        "INV-002", "TWO", "PO-002"
    )
    
    assert result.status == MatchStatus.PRICE_VARIANCE
    assert result.confidence_score < 0.85
    assert result.auto_approval_eligible == False
    assert any(v.type == VarianceType.PRICE_VARIANCE for v in result.variances)
```

## 🔄 **3-WAY MATCHING IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Overview**
3-way matching compares invoices against both Purchase Orders and Receipts/Shipments in the GP Purchase Order Processing module, providing comprehensive validation of goods and services received.

### **Advanced Features**

#### **Multiple Shipments Handling**
```python
async def test_multiple_shipments():
    # Handle complex scenario with multiple shipments per PO
    result = await gp_integration.perform_three_way_match(
        invoice_id="INV-2024-001",
        company_db="TWO", 
        po_number="PO-2024-001",
        include_all_shipments=True  # Include all related shipments
    )
    
    print(f"Shipments Found: {len(result.shipment_data)}")
    
    # Analyze multiple shipments scenario
    for i, shipment in enumerate(result.shipment_data):
        print(f"Shipment {i+1}: {shipment.shipment_number}")
        print(f"  Receipt Date: {shipment.receipt_date}")
        print(f"  Amount: ${shipment.total_amount}")
        print(f"  Status: {shipment.status}")
```

#### **Progressive Delivery Scenarios**
```python
# Scenario 1: Cumulative Match
# Multiple shipments that together equal the invoice amount
shipments = [
    {"number": "SHIP-001", "amount": 800.00, "date": "2024-01-10"},
    {"number": "SHIP-002", "amount": 200.00, "date": "2024-01-11"}, 
    {"number": "SHIP-003", "amount": 250.00, "date": "2024-01-12"}
]
# Total: $1,250.00 (matches invoice)
# Strategy: "cumulative_match" - approve based on total receipts

# Scenario 2: Partial Billing
# Invoice for partial delivery while awaiting remaining goods
shipments = [
    {"number": "SHIP-001", "amount": 800.00, "date": "2024-01-10"},
    {"number": "SHIP-002", "amount": 200.00, "date": "2024-01-11"}
]
# Total: $1,000.00 (invoice: $1,250.00)
# Strategy: "partial_billing" - hold for additional delivery
```

### **Implementation**

#### **Basic 3-Way Match**
```python
async def perform_three_way_match_example():
    result = await gp_integration.perform_three_way_match(
        invoice_id="INV-2024-001",
        company_db="TWO",
        po_number="PO-2024-001",
        include_all_shipments=True
    )
    
    # Analyze match quality
    confidence_breakdown = result.confidence_breakdown if hasattr(result, 'confidence_breakdown') else {}
    
    print(f"Overall Confidence: {result.confidence_score:.1%}")
    print(f"PO Match: {confidence_breakdown.get('po_match', 0):.1%}")
    print(f"Shipment Match: {confidence_breakdown.get('shipment_match', 0):.1%}")
    print(f"Consistency: {confidence_breakdown.get('consistency', 0):.1%}")
    print(f"Multi-Shipment: {confidence_breakdown.get('multi_shipment', 1.0):.1%}")
```

### **Test Scenarios**

#### **Perfect 3-Way Match**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_perfect_three_way_match():
    """Test perfect 3-way match with single shipment"""
    
    # Invoice: $1,250.00
    # PO: $1,250.00  
    # Shipment: $1,250.00
    # Expected: PERFECT_MATCH, 99%+ confidence
    
    result = await gp_integration.perform_three_way_match(
        "INV-001", "TWO", "PO-001"
    )
    
    assert result.status == MatchStatus.PERFECT_MATCH
    assert result.confidence_score >= 0.99
    assert len(result.shipment_data) == 1
    assert result.auto_approval_eligible == True
```

#### **Multiple Shipments Scenario**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_multiple_shipments_cumulative():
    """Test 3-way match with multiple shipments totaling invoice amount"""
    
    # Invoice: $1,250.00
    # PO: $1,250.00
    # Shipments: $800 + $200 + $250 = $1,250.00
    # Expected: GOOD_MATCH, requires manual review due to complexity
    
    result = await gp_integration.perform_three_way_match(
        "INV-001", "TWO", "PO-001", include_all_shipments=True
    )
    
    assert result.status == MatchStatus.GOOD_MATCH
    assert len(result.shipment_data) == 3
    assert result.auto_approval_eligible == False  # Complex scenario
    
    # Verify cumulative amount matches
    total_shipped = sum(s.total_amount for s in result.shipment_data)
    assert total_shipped == result.invoice_data["total_amount"]
```

#### **Partial Shipments Scenario**
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_partial_shipments_variance():
    """Test 3-way match with partial shipments creating variance"""
    
    # Invoice: $1,250.00 (full amount)
    # PO: $1,250.00
    # Shipments: $800 + $200 = $1,000.00 (partial delivery)
    # Expected: QUANTITY_VARIANCE, hold for additional delivery
    
    result = await gp_integration.perform_three_way_match(
        "INV-001", "TWO", "PO-001", include_all_shipments=True
    )
    
    assert result.status == MatchStatus.QUANTITY_VARIANCE
    assert len(result.variances) > 0
    assert result.auto_approval_eligible == False
    assert result.gp_posting_required == False  # Don't post until resolved
```

## 📊 **TOLERANCE MANAGEMENT**

### **Configurable Tolerances**
```python
# Default GP tolerances (can be customized per company)
gp_tolerances = {
    "price_tolerance_percentage": 2.0,      # 2% price variance allowed
    "quantity_tolerance_percentage": 5.0,   # 5% quantity variance allowed  
    "amount_tolerance_absolute": 10.0,      # $10 absolute variance allowed
    "auto_approval_limit": 2000.0,          # $2,000 auto-approval limit
    "variance_investigation_threshold": 100.0 # $100 investigation threshold
}
```

### **Auto-Approval Rules**
```python
def determine_auto_approval(match_result):
    """Determine if invoice qualifies for auto-approval"""
    
    # Must meet ALL criteria:
    criteria = [
        match_result.confidence_score >= 0.95,           # 95%+ confidence
        match_result.total_variance <= Decimal("10.00"), # Within $10 variance
        match_result.invoice_total <= 2000.00,           # Under $2,000 limit
        len([v for v in match_result.variances           # No critical variances
             if not v.within_tolerance]) == 0,
        match_result.status == MatchStatus.PERFECT_MATCH # Perfect or excellent match
    ]
    
    return all(criteria)
```

## 🔗 **GP POSTING INTEGRATION**

### **eConnect Integration**
```python
async def post_to_gp_payables():
    """Post matched invoice to GP Payables Management"""
    
    # Build eConnect XML document
    econnect_xml = gp_integration._build_econnect_invoice_xml(
        match_result, "TWO"
    )
    
    # Submit to GP via eConnect
    posting_result = await gp_integration.post_invoice_to_gp(
        match_result, "TWO", "econnect"
    )
    
    print(f"Posting Status: {posting_result['status']}")
    print(f"GP Document Number: {posting_result['gp_document_number']}")
    print(f"Posted Amount: ${posting_result['posted_amount']}")
```

### **GL Account Mapping**
```python
# Automatic GL account suggestion based on vendor and PO
gl_accounts = await gp_integration._get_default_gl_accounts(
    vendor_id="CONTOSO001", 
    company_db="TWO"
)

# Example GL mapping
suggested_accounts = {
    "expense": "5000-000",      # Office Supplies Expense
    "freight": "5100-000",      # Freight Expense  
    "tax": "2300-000",          # Sales Tax Payable
