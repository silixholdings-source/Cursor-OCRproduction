# 🔧 Next.js Routing Conflict - FIXED

## ✅ ROUTING CONFLICT RESOLVED

### **❌ Error:**
```
You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path. 
Please check /(main)/support/page and /support/page.
```

### **✅ Root Cause:**
- Duplicate support pages in different route groups
- `web/src/app/(main)/support/page.tsx` (conflicting)
- `web/src/app/support/page.tsx` (main)

### **✅ Solution Applied:**
- ✅ **Removed:** `web/src/app/(main)/support/page.tsx`
- ✅ **Kept:** `web/src/app/support/page.tsx` (redirects to /help)
- ✅ **Result:** No more routing conflicts

## 🔍 **ROUTE STRUCTURE VERIFIED**

### **✅ Clean Route Structure:**
```
/app/
├── (main)/               # Route group for marketing pages
│   ├── privacy/page.tsx  # Legal pages
│   ├── terms/page.tsx
│   ├── security/page.tsx
│   └── ...
├── support/page.tsx      # Support redirect (no conflict)
├── help/page.tsx         # Help center
├── dashboard/            # Dashboard routes
│   ├── settings/page.tsx
│   ├── approvals/page.tsx
│   └── ...
└── auth/                 # Authentication routes
    ├── login/page.tsx
    └── register/page.tsx
```

### **✅ No More Conflicts:**
- Each path resolves to exactly one page
- Route groups properly organized
- Clean URL structure maintained
