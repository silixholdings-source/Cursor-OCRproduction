# üöÄ AI ERP SaaS - Manual Production Deployment Checklist

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Complete ALL items before deployment**

---

## ‚úÖ **PRE-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**

### **1. Test Suite Verification**
- [ ] **Run all tests**: `npm test` in backend directory
- [ ] **Verify 197/197 tests passing**: Check test output shows 100% success
- [ ] **Run health check**: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] **Verify API endpoints**: Test key endpoints respond correctly

### **2. Security Configuration**
- [ ] **Generate secure secrets**:
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32  # For SECRET_KEY
  openssl rand -base64 32  # For JWT_SECRET
  ```
- [ ] **Update .env.production** with actual production values:
  - [ ] Database credentials (PostgreSQL with SSL)
  - [ ] Redis connection string
  - [ ] CORS origins (restrict to production domains)
  - [ ] Allowed hosts (restrict to production IPs)
  - [ ] API keys (Azure, AWS, etc.)
- [ ] **Verify SSL certificates** are valid and not expired
- [ ] **Check security headers** are properly configured

### **3. Infrastructure Requirements**
- [ ] **Docker Desktop** is running and accessible
- [ ] **PostgreSQL database** is available and accessible
- [ ] **Redis instance** is running and accessible
- [ ] **SSL certificates** are properly installed
- [ ] **Domain/DNS** is configured for production

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT EXECUTION**

### **4. Automated Deployment**
- [ ] **Navigate to backend directory**: `cd backend`
- [ ] **Make script executable**: `chmod +x deploy-production.sh`
- [ ] **Run deployment script**: `./deploy-production.sh`
- [ ] **Monitor deployment logs** for any errors
- [ ] **Verify all services start**: Check Docker Compose status

### **5. Manual Deployment (Alternative)**
If automated script fails:
- [ ] **Build Docker images**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml build`
- [ ] **Start services**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d`
- [ ] **Configure Nginx** separately with provided `nginx.conf`
- [ ] **Set up SSL certificates** in `./certs/` directory

## üîç **POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION**

### **6. Service Health Checks**
- [ ] **Backend health**: `curl https://your-domain.com/health`
- [ ] **Database connection**: Verify PostgreSQL is accessible
- [ ] **Redis connection**: Verify Redis is responding
- [ ] **Nginx status**: Check reverse proxy is working
- [ ] **SSL certificate**: Verify HTTPS is enforced

### **7. Security Verification**
- [ ] **Security headers**: Check CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options headers
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Test API rate limits are active
- [ ] **Authentication**: Verify JWT authentication works
- [ ] **CORS**: Confirm CORS is restricted to production domains
- [ ] **File uploads**: Test secure file upload validation

### **8. Functionality Testing**
- [ ] **Invoice processing**: Test end-to-end invoice workflow

- [ ] **File backups**: Confirm uploaded files are backed up
- [ ] **Configuration backups**: Backup all configuration files
- [ ] **Recovery testing**: Test restore procedures
- [ ] **Disaster recovery plan**: Document recovery procedures
